# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Day 1 [Linux CLI - Shells Bells]

_McSkidy has been kidnapped and first lead points to the tbfc-web01, a Linux server processing Christmas wishlists. 
Somewhere within its data may lie the truth: traces of McSkidy’s final actions._

After successfully accessing the VM, I began the investigation by opening a terminal session. 
Following the initial guidance, I proceeded by accessing the README.txt file to gather more information related to the challenge.

Inside the current directory, I identified a folder named Guides. 
Listing its contents, including hidden files, revealed a file called .guide.txt. 
Accessing this file led to the discovery of the first flag for the task.
